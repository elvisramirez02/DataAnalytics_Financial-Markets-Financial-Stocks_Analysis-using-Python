# Financial Stocks Analysis using Python 📈💡

Hi there! 👋 I'm Elvis Ramirez, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning enthusiast. 
In this project, I delve into financial stocks analysis using Python, leveraging various libraries and tools to derive insightful conclusions that can aid in stock investments and financial analysis.

## Overview 🌟
This project involves analyzing financial stocks using Python to perform various calculations such as present value, future value, net present value (NPV), and more. It includes the use of decision trees and random forests to analyze stock data, as well as constructing an optimally weighted portfolio using Monte-Carlo simulations.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas DataReader**: For reading data from various sources
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **yFinance**: For fetching historical market data
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization

## Analyses Performed 🔍

### 1. Calculate Present Value (PV) 💰
- The present value of future cash flows to understand the current worth of an investment.

### 2. Calculate Future Value (FV) 📈
- The future value of current investments to project the potential growth.

### 3. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation 🏦
- Determine the profitability of an investment by calculating the net present value.

### 4. Decision Trees and Random Forest Analysis 🌳🌲
- Analyze the pros and cons of decision trees and random forests for stock analysis.

### 5. Historical Data Analysis 📊
- **5.1 Download 5-year historical data for 2 stocks and store their Adjusted Close prices.**
- **5.2 Calculate the Daily and Annual Return.**
- **5.3 Analyze annual risk values and their impact on investment decisions.**

### 6. Multiple Stocks Analysis 📈
- **6.1 Download data for 5 stocks and store their Adjusted Close prices.**
- **6.2 Calculate the returns of each stock using Log Returns.**
- **6.3 Calculate the annual portfolio return assuming equal weighting for each stock.**
- **6.4 Calculate their covariance and correlation matrix.**
- **6.5 Calculate the annual portfolio risk assuming equal weighting for each stock.**

### 7. Portfolio Optimization 🧠
- **7.1 Construct a 2-stock portfolio based on 5 years of historical adjusted close prices.**
- **7.2 Use Monte-Carlo simulations to construct an optimally weighted portfolio.**

Potential Business Use Cases 📊💼
Investment Decision Making: Use historical stock data to make informed investment decisions.
Risk Management: Calculate and analyze risk to optimize portfolios and minimize potential losses.
Financial Forecasting: Project future values and returns to plan long-term investment strategies.
Portfolio Optimization: Construct and optimize portfolios using advanced statistical techniques and simulations.

Conclusion 🚀
This project showcases the power of Python in financial analysis and machine learning. By leveraging various technologies and methodologies, we can derive meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions in stock investments and financial planning.
